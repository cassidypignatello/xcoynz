            Our solution will address the problem of exchanging fiat to Crypto, Crypto to Crypto and Crypto to fiat, all under one roof, namely the XCOYNZ Exchange. The XCOYNZ Exchange will also address high fees by allowing the Individual to define the fee that they would like to pay for their transaction. It will also accelerate the transfer of Crypto assets back to the Individualâ€™s fiat bank account faster than existing methods, using our custom-built technology known as X-Swift based on a private XCOYNZ Blockchain, with the ultimate goal of being near-instantaneous.<br /><br />
            The XCOYNZ Exchange enables Individuals to set their own fee when exchanging their Crypto assets. This will be based on a recurring annual allowance from the time of first registration, with further loyalty bonuses being awarded based on periodic exchange activity volume.
